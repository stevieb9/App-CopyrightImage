=head1 DESCRIPTION

This C<imgcopyright> application allows you to add copyright information to
the EXIF data within image files. It also allows you to check images for
missing copyright info and remove info.

It works on individual files, as well as recurses (top-level only) of a
supplied directory.

It does NOT modify the original file. We create a subdirectory named C<ci>
in whatever path you specify (current working directory if a path is not sent
in), and we then take a copy of each original file, modify it, prefix the
filename with a C<ci_>, and place it into the new C<ci> directory.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=head2 -i, --image

Mandatory in all cases.

Name of a single image file, or a directory containing image files. In the case
of a directory, we'll iterate over the top level, and work on all image files
found.

=head2 -n, --name

Mandatory, unless using C<--check>.

This is the name that will be used in the copyright string for the C<Copyright>
EXIF tag, as well as the C<Creator> tag.

=head2 -e, --email

Optional.

This is appended to the C<--name> when populating the C<Creator> EXIF tag if
it is sent in.

=head2 -c, --check

Optional.

Checks for missing C<Copyright> and/or C<Creator> EXIF tags in the image(s)
sent in with the C<--image> option.

=head2 -d, --dst

Optional.

By default, we use the directory sent in with C<--image> (current working
directory if a path isn't provided), and put all modified images in a new C<ci>
directory under it. 

Send in a directory path with this option and we'll put the image files there
instead.

=head2 -r, --remove

Optional.

Removes copyright EXIF information for files sent in with C<--image>.

=head2 -f, --force

By default, if an image already has EXIF copyright information, we skip
over it and do nothing. Set this option to overwrite any found copyright
info.
