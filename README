SYNOPSYS

        # single image, will be put into ./ci_picture.jpg

        imgcopyright -i picture.jpg -n "steve" --force

DESCRIPTION

    This imgcopyright application allows you to add copyright information
    to the EXIF data within image files. It also allows you to check images
    for missing copyright info and remove info.

    It works on individual files, as well as recurses (top-level only) of a
    supplied directory.

    It does NOT modify the original file. We create a subdirectory named ci
    in whatever path you specify (current working directory if a path is
    not sent in), and we then take a copy of each original file, modify it,
    prefix the filename with a ci_, and place it into the new ci directory.

ARGUMENTS

 -i, --image

    Mandatory in all cases.

    Name of a single image file, or a directory containing image files. In
    the case of a directory, we'll iterate over the top level, and work on
    all image files found.

 -n, --name

    Mandatory, unless using --check.

    This is the name that will be used in the copyright string for the
    Copyright EXIF tag, as well as the Creator tag.

 -e, --email

    Optional.

    This is appended to the --name when populating the Creator EXIF tag if
    it is sent in.

 -c, --check

    Optional.

    Checks for missing Copyright and/or Creator EXIF tags in the image(s)
    sent in with the --image option.

 -d, --dst

    Optional.

    By default, we use the directory sent in with --image (current working
    directory if a path isn't provided), and put all modified images in a
    new ci directory under it.

    Send in a directory path with this option and we'll put the image files
    there instead.

 -r, --remove

    Optional.

    Removes copyright EXIF information for files sent in with --image.

 -f, --force

    By default, if an image already has EXIF copyright information, we skip
    over it and do nothing. Set this option to overwrite any found
    copyright info.

App::CopyrightImage API

 EXPORTS

    Exports imgcopyright by default.

 FUNCTIONS

  imgcopyright(%opts)

    Sets up various configurations, and then executes the EXIF changes to
    images sent in.

    We set the Copyright EXIF tag to Copyright (C) YEAR by NAME, where YEAR
    is auto-generated, and NAME is sent in as an option (see below).

    We also set the Creator EXIF tag to NAME (EMAIL). If EMAIL is not sent
    in as an option, it, and the parens around it will be omitted.

    Returns a hash reference with the following keys: ok and fail. Each key
    contains an array reference. The former contains a list of the image
    names that succeeded, and the latter, a list of image names that
    failed.

    Options:

   image

    A string containing either an image filename (including full path if
    not local), or the name of a directory containing images. If the value
    is a directory, we'll operate on all images in that dir.

    We will, by default, create a new sub-directory named ci in the
    directory found in the value, and if the directory is current working
    directory, we'll create the sub directory there.

    All updated images will be copied into the new ci directory with the
    same filename, with a <C>ci_</c> prepended to it.

    Eg: "/home/user/Pictures"

   check

    We won't make any changes, we'll simply check all images specified with
    the image option, and if they are missing either Copyright or Creator
    EXIF data, we'll print this information to STDOUT.

   name

    A string containing the name you want associated with the copyright
    notice. It will be used in both the Copyright and Creator EXIF tags.

    Eg: "Steve Bertrand"

   email

    A string containing the email address of the copyright holder. This
    will be included in the Creator EXIF tag if sent in.

    Eg: "steveb@cpan.org"

   dst

    A string containing the name of a directory to be used to store the
    manipulated images. By default, we use the path sent in with the image
    option.

    Eg: "/home/user/backup"

   remove

    Bool. If set, we'll remove all copyright information on the image(s).

   force

    Bool. If set, if an image already has copyright information set, we'll
    overwrite it. By default we skip these files.
