    App::CopyrightImage - Easily add copyright information to your images

        # single image, will be put into ./ci_picture.jpg
        # we set the 'Copyright' and 'Creator' EXIF tags
    
        imgcopyright --image picture.jpg --name "Steve Bertrand"
    
        # all images within a directory, images put into
        # /home/user/Pictures/ci
    
        imgcopyright -i /home/user/Pictures -n "Steve Bertrand"
    
        # check an image (or directory of images) for files with no
        # copyright info
    
        imgcopyright -i /home/user/Pictures --check
    
        # add an email along with your name to the 'Creator' tag
    
        imgcopyright -i picture.jpg -n "Steve Bertrand" --email "steveb@cpan.org"
    
        # specify an alternate directory for the altered images
    
        imgcopyright -i /home/user/Pictures -name "steve" --dst ~/mypics
    
        # remove copyright info from image(s)
    
        imgcopyright -i picture.jpg --remove
    
        # force over a previous copyright
    
        imgcopyright -i picture.jpg -n "steve" --force

    This imgcopyright application allows you to add copyright information
    to the EXIF data within image files. It also allows you to check images
    for missing copyright info and remove info.

    It works on individual files, as well as recurses (top-level only) of a
    supplied directory.

    It does NOT modify the original file. We create a subdirectory named ci
    in whatever path you specify (current working directory if a path is
    not sent in), and we then take a copy of each original file, modify it,
    prefix the filename with a ci_, and place it into the new ci directory.

OPTIONS

 -i, --image

    Mandatory in all cases.

    Name of a single image file, or a directory containing image files. In
    the case of a directory, we'll iterate over the top level, and work on
    all image files found.

 -n, --name

    Mandatory, unless using --check.

    This is the name that will be used in the copyright string for the
    Copyright EXIF tag, as well as the Creator tag.

 -e, --email

    Optional.

    This is appended to the --name when populating the Creator EXIF tag if
    it is sent in.

 -c, --check

    Optional.

    Checks for missing Copyright and/or Creator EXIF tags in the image(s)
    sent in with the --image option.

 -d, --dst

    Optional.

    By default, we use the directory sent in with --image (current working
    directory if a path isn't provided), and put all modified images in a
    new ci directory under it.

    Send in a directory path with this option and we'll put the image files
    there instead.

 -r, --remove

    Optional.

    Removes copyright EXIF information for files sent in with --image.

 -f, --force

    By default, if an image already has EXIF copyright information, we skip
    over it and do nothing. Set this option to overwrite any found
    copyright info.
